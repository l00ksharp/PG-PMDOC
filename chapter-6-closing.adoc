==== Closing a work package or a project

The completion of all processes and activities should be verified to ensure that the deliverables of the project phase or project were provided and specific project management processes were either completed or terminated prior to completion. All project documents should be collected and archived in accordance with the prevailing standards and all project personnel and other resources should be released.

A project may need to be terminated prior to completion, if customers no longer require the project deliverables or if it becomes obvious that some or all of the objectives cannot be met. Unless special grounds exist, terminating a project should comprise the same activities as closing a project, even though there may not be a deliverable to release to the customers. All the documentation for a terminated project should be collected and archived in accordance with organizational requirements.

==== Collect lessons learned

Collecting lessons learned is useful to evaluate the project and collect experiences, in order to benefit current and future projects.

Throughout the project, the project team and key stakeholders identify lessons learned concerning the technical, managerial and process aspects of the project. The lessons learned should be captured, compiled, formalized, stored, disseminated and used throughout the project. Therefore, at some level lessons learned may be outputs of every project management process and may result in updated project plans.
