== Initiating a project

A project starts with a formalized change request, a business case, a set of documents or … just an idea. The goal of the initiating phase is to give a better understanding of the project in order to formally authorize the actual start of the project or a new project phase.

The project charter documents the business needs, project objectives, expected deliverables and the economic aspects of the project as well as the project team, activities and responsibilities.

The project charter also links the project to the strategic objectives of the organization and should identify any appropriate terms of reference, obligations, assumptions and constraints.

==== Develop project charter

Developing the project charter is the first and most important step of the project initiation phase. The purpose of developing a project charter is as follows:

to formally authorize a project or a new project phase;

to identify the project manager and the appropriate project manager responsibilities and authorities;

to document the business needs, project objectives, expected deliverables and the economic aspects of the project.

The project charter links the project to the strategic objectives of the organization and should identify any appropriate terms of reference, obligations, assumptions and constraints.

The project charter includes the project plans.

|image:media/image6.png[Notes Post-it contour,width=45,height=45] |*Note:* business needs can be translated into user stories / requirements (in turn organised into epics) which will form the basis of the Product Backlog. Sometimes the development of the project charter is also called the scoping phase of the project. Whatever the project lifecycle, a project charter needs to be produced. Some agile projects call this phase the Sprint 0.

==== Identify Stakeholders 

The purpose of Identify stakeholders is to determine the individuals, groups or organizations affected by, or affecting, the project and to document relevant information regarding their interest and involvement.

Stakeholders may be actively involved in the project, may be internal or external to the project and may be at varying authority levels.

==== Establish the project team

The purpose of Establish project team is to acquire the human resources needed to complete the project.

The project manager should determine how and when project team members will be acquired, as well as how and they will be released from the project. When human resources are not available inside the organization, consideration should be given to hiring additional resources or subcontracting work to another organization. The work location, commitment, roles and responsibilities, as well as reporting and communication requirements should be established.

The project manager may or may not have absolute control over the selection of the project team members, but the project manager should be involved in their selection. The project manager, when possible, should take into consideration factors such as skills and expertise, different personalities and group dynamics when establishing the project team. Because projects are typically performed in a changing environment, this process is normally performed continuously throughout the project.
